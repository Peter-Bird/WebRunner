The runner application is a lightweight, extensible tool designed to manage web services on a local machine. It reads configurations from a JSON file, dynamically compiles and starts a predefined set of services, and supports adding or removing services during runtime. With built-in logging, a dashboard for real-time feedback, and a graceful shutdown mechanism, the application ensures efficient service management. It is scalable, configurable, and designed for future enhancements like health monitoring and secure access, making it a robust foundation for managing up to 1000 services.
